        <h2>
            This is a sample web-page used for practice. <br>
            If window.location.replace was used to reach this page, then the user cannot go back to the last page as it replaces the page itself <br> and does not generate any browser history, unlike the window.location.assign method. <br>
            Using the location.href method to change the location of the web-page also creates browser history.
